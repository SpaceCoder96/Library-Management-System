<HTML><br>Jonathan Swift was an Anglo-Irish satirist, essayist, political pamphleteer, poet, and Anglican cleric who became Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, hence his common sobriquet, "Dean Swift". Swift is remembered for works such as A Tale of a Tub, An Argument Against Abolishing Christianity, Gulliver's Travels, and A Modest Proposal. He is regarded by the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica as the foremost prose satirist in the English language, and is less well known for his poetry. He was a master of two styles of satire, the Horatian and Juvenalian styles.</HTML>
